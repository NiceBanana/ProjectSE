# Ringland

## Explanation
The result of the course 'Project Software Engineering' during my first year of Computer Science at the University of Antwerp. 
The project simulates an environment where cars and buses pass through roads that have traffic lights and bus stops.
We had integrated a GUI as well, but that part, which was saved in another project, has unfortunately been lost over time.
